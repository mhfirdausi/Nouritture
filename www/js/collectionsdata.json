      "Background": "In 1492 as the Spanish explored the New World, they discovered the natives had a wooden device for smoking fish, lizards, and small animals which to them sounded like \"barbacoa\". Smoked meats were common in Europe long before Columbus, both for the flavor and because smoke helped preserve food, but the barbacoa technique was different and it quickly became popular with explorers.\r\nThe first barbecue sauces were mostly butter. In \"Nouveaux Voyages aux Isles d'Amerique\" by Frenchman Jean B. Labot in 1693, there is a description of a barbecued whole hog that is stuffed with aromatic herbs and spices, roasted belly up, and basted with a sauce of melted butter, cayenne pepper, and sage, a popular technique from back home that probably came to the new world via the French West Indies by slaves and Creoles. The French are incapable of making anything without butter. The French also were big on meat juices in their sauces, an ingredient still found in some homebrewed Texas barbecue sauces and more recently in Adam Perry Lang's Board Sauces.\r\nThe German fondness of pork with mustard resulted in the wonderful yellow barbecue sauces still popular in a band of South Carolina from Charleston to Columbia.\r\nIn 1867, just after the end of the Civil War, after all the slave cooks were freed, the Georgia widow Mrs. A.P. Hill published Mrs. Hill's New Cook Book dedicated \"to young and inexperienced Southern housekeepers... in this peculiar crisis of our domestic as well as national affairs\". It contains the first reference I have found for a sauce for barbecue. It is mostly butter and vinegar: \"Sauce for Barbecues. - Melt half a pound of butter; stir into it a large tablespoon of mustard, half a teaspoon of red pepper, one of black, salt to taste; add vinegar until the sauce has a strong acid taste. The quantity of vinegar will depend upon the strength of it. As soon as the meat becomes hot, begin to baste, and continue basting frequently until it is done; pour over the meat any sauce that remains.\" Interestingly, Mrs. Hill shares many \"catsup\" recipes, among them two for tomato catsup that are pretty close to what we know today. Originally ketchup was probably made from fermented fish.\r\nThe first mention of \"barbecue sauce\" found in text was in the Bolivar Bulletin from Hardeman County, TN in 1871. The author of an article thanks a Dr. J.H. Larwill for \"a fine lot of Barbecue Sauce, of his own invention. For fresh meats of all kinds it cannot be excelled.\"\r\nAccording to an article in Eatocracy, several newspaper articles from the 1880s described barbecue sauces like Mrs. Hills: Mostly butter and vinegar seasoned with salt and black pepper, not unlike the sauces still popular on the coast of the Carolinas today.\r\n"

      "King Cake Background": "What is King Cake\r\nKing Cakes are a vibrant part of the Mardi Gras tradition in New Orleans.\r\nAs part of New Orleans's Christian faith, the coming of the wise men bearing gifts to the Christ Child is celebrated twelve days after Christmas. We refer to this as the Feast of the Epiphany, or Little Christmas on the Twelfth Night. This is a time of celebration, exchanging gifts and feasting. Today, the tradition continues as people all over the world gather for festive Twelfth Night celebrations. A popular custom was and still is the baking of a special cake in honor of the three kings, called \"A King's Cake.\"\r\nEach king cake has a tiny baby inside (generally plastic now, but it's possible the baby might be made of porcelain or even gold). The tradition of King Cake Parties have evolved over time, and the \"lucky\" person who receives the slice of cake with the baby is asked to continue the festivities by having the next King Cake party (or at least purchasing the next cake for the office).\r\nOriginally, king cakes were a simple ring of dough with a small amount of decoration. Today's king cakes are much more festive. After the rich Danish dough is braided and baked, the \"baby\" is inserted. The top of the ring or oval cake is then covered with delicious sugar toppings in the traditional Mardi Gras colors of purple, green and gold.\r\nIn more recent years, some bakeries have been creative with stuffing and topping their cakes with different flavors of cream cheese and fruit fillings.\r\nJan. 6, the Twelfth Night after Christmas, is the day our Mardi Gras season, hence king cake season, begins. Mardi Gras Day, also known as Fat Tuesday, is always 47 days prior to Easter Sunday (the day before Ash Wednesday).\r\nMardi Gras and King Cakes go hand in hand...especially in Louisiana. Hundreds of thousands of king cakes are consumed at parties, offices and in homes every year.\r\nThe History of King Cakes\r\nToday in New Orleans, the King Cake is an oval-shaped braided cake similar to a coffee cake which has cinnamon within the braids and is decorated with icing and sugar the colors of gold (God's power), green (faith in Christ), and purple (Justice of God) - and contains a tiny plastic baby symbolic of the Baby Jesus usually baked within but sometimes placed within the cake after it has been baked.\r\nReligious tradition is bound to the King Cake. Thus, it is not surprising that the origin of the modern King Cake can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when popular devotion during Christmas not only centered on Jesus Christ, but, also included an interest in the \"Three Wise Men,\" or \"kings,\" who had followed a star leading them to pay homage to the Christ Child. The \"Epiphany,\" a Christian festival held on January 6th honors the \"Three Wise Men\" for having sought the worlds' Savior. It is also referred to as \"Twelfth Night\" since it arrives 12 days after Christmas. As such, the English definition of the term \"epiphany\" is \"a moment in which you suddenly see or understand something in a new or very clear way.\" The \"Three Wise Men\" are considered \"wise\" because they sought the Savior!\r\n",
      "King Cake Recipes": "KING CAKE DOUGH INGREDIENTS:\r\n4 packages active dry yeast\r\n1\/2 cup lukewarm water (110-115 degrees F)\r\n1\/2 cup granulated sugar\r\n1 tablespoon salt\r\n1\/2 cup cold milk\r\n1 cup plain or vanilla yogurt\r\n2 teaspoons lemon juice\r\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n2 egg yolks, lightly beaten\r\n1 stick butter or margarine\r\n5-6 1\/2 cups all-purpose flour\r\nKING CAKE FILLING INGREDIENTS:\r\n1 stick butter or margarine, melted\r\n2 cups granulated sugar\r\n3 tablespoons ground cinnamon\r\n2 dried bean, shelled pecans, or naked plastic babies\r\nKING CAKE ICING INGREDIENTS:\r\n3 tablespoons soft butter or margarine\r\n4 cups confectioner\u2019s sugar\r\n1 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract\r\n4-6 tablespoons milk\r\nKING CAKE DIRECTIONS:\r\nCombine the yeast, 1\/2 of the sugar, and the lukewarm water in a very large bowl, stir well and set aside for a few minutes until the mixture swells slightly and small bubbles appear on the surface.\r\nStir in the remaining sugar, milk, yogurt, lemon juice, vanilla and salt. Mix well. Add egg yolks and mix again.\r\nIn another bowl, work the butter\/margarine into 5 cups of the flour. Add the flour-butter\/margarine mixture to the yeast mixture a cup at a time, mixing well after each cup is added. Begin to knead in the bowl, adding more flour if necessary to make a smooth, elastic dough.\r\nTurn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead about 5 minutes, adding more flour if the dough is still sticky. Shape the dough into a ball and place in a bowl which has been buttered or sprayed with a no-stick spray. Cover and let stand in a warm place until dough doubles in size. Punch dough down and divide in half. Roll each half on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 8 x 14 inches.\r\nBrush each rectangle with 1\/2 stick of melted butter or margarine. Combine the sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle 1\/2 of the mixture over each rectangle. Roll up from the wide end, as you would a jelly roll, inserting one of the dried beans, pecans, or naked babies along the way. Press the ends of the dough together and stretch the roll into an oval about 14 inches long.\r\nPlace on a greased\/sprayed cookie sheet and allow to rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F oven for about 35-45 minutes until the cakes are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped with the fingers. Remove from the oven and cool for 30 minutes.\r\nBeat the butter or margarine until softened. Add confectioner\u2019s sugar and vanilla and continue to beat, gradually adding milk until a glaze consistency is achieved. Use half of the icing on each cake. Spread the icing evenly over each cake and decorate immediately with granulated sugar that has been rendered purple, green and gold with food coloring, making alternating bands of color.\r\nOther decorating options: Divide the icing into three portions and use food coloring to make purple, green and gold icing. Spread in alternating bands along the length of the cakes. Use purple, green and gold gumdrops, jelly beans, or other candy to decorate the white icing.\r\n",
      "King Cake Bread Pudding": "\u2022\t1 small King Cake, cubed (8-10 cups) and plastic baby discarded\r\n\u2022\t1 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened\r\n\u2022\t4 tablespoons butter, softened\r\n\u2022\t1 cup sugar\r\n\u2022\t2 eggs\r\n\u2022\t1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk\r\n\u2022\t2 cups half-n-half\r\n\u2022\t2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\r\n\u2022\t2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\r\n\u2022\tPinch of salt\r\n\u2022\t3 cups powdered sugar\r\n\u2022\t4 tablespoons milk\r\n\u2022\t3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\r\n\u2022\tPurple, green and gold (yellow) sugar sprinkles*\r\n\u2022\tWhiskey Sauce, recipe follows\r\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F.
