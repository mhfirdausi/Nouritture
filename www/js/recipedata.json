      "Equipment": "Remember that deep fry turkey cooker that\u2019s lurking in the back of the kitchen closet? That is exactly what you need for a crawfish boil. The large pot with a tight fitting lid will be perfect. You will also need a wire basket insert to remove the crawfish and vegetables after they are cooked. The whole assembly sits on a propane burner. You will also need a large tub or ice chest (the one that the crawfish are shipped in is perfect), or a couple of bags of ice. A stirring paddle or long-handled spoon is useful too.",

      "Crawfish Boil": "Many New Orleans cooks recommend Zataran\u2019s crab boil, which comes in dry and liquid forms. If you are a DIY cook, Alton Brown has a recipe for crawfish spice mix, or if you just want to make it easy\u2026 and extra delicious, use the seasoning that comes with your crawfish order (it\u2019s cajuncrawfish.com\u2019s special blend). If you\u2019re a foodie and want to mix your own\u2026 grind 1 tablespoon each of whole black peppercorns and whole coriander seeds, 2 tablespoons whole cloves and 1 \u00BD tablespoons whole allspice in a spice grinder. Mix ground spices together with 4 tablespoons cayenne pepper, 2 tablespoons garlic powder, 2 tablespoons paprika, and 1 tablespoon each of onion powder, dried thyme, dried oregano, dry mustard, dried dill weed, plus 6 crumbled bay leaves. Add the spice mix and 1 pound of kosher salt to 5 gallons of boiling water for the crab boil. This is enough spice to boil 10 pounds of crawfish. If using cajuncrawfish.com spice, use 1 bag per 10 lbs. of crawfish.",
      "Directions": "Add 5 gallons of water to the pot for each 10 pounds of crawfish. When the water boils, add half of the spice mix. Add the potatoes, corn, onions and garlic to the pot and cover. If you are adding andouille sausage, this is the time to add it, too. Let cook for ten minutes, then add the crawfish and replace the cover. Ed the Crawfish Master at the Cajun Crawfish Company says to watch for steam to escape from under the lid. When this happens, turn off the gas.\r\nYou can remove the basket from the pot and transfer the crawfish to an ice chest. Add one third of the crawfish to the chest, sprinkle with spice mix; add another third of the crawfish, sprinkle with spice mix, and then add the rest of the crawfish and sprinkle with more spices. You can also add two bags of ice to the pot instead of removing the crawfish. The ice will cool them down and they will sink to the bottom and absorb more spices.\r\n"

      "What are beignets?": "Beignet, synonymous with the English \"fritter\", is the French term for a pastry made from deep-fried choux pastry. Beignets can also be made from other types of dough, including yeast dough. They are typically fried and topped with powdered sugar.",
      "History of beignets": "While the exact origins of beignets are cause for debate, it is known that the French colonists of the eighteenth century are responsible for introducing the deep fried pastry to New Orleans. Some believe it was the Ursuline nuns of France who brought the recipe with them when they came to Louisiana in 1727. The original beignets were fried fritters sometimes filled with fruit. Today they are most commonly served as a square piece of fried dough liberally covered with powdered sugar and an occasional sprinkle of cinnamon.\r\n",
      "Ingredients": "1 1\/2 cups lukewarm water\r\n1\/2 cup granulated sugar\r\n1 envelope active dry yeast\r\n2 eggs, slightly beaten\r\n1 1\/4 teaspoons salt\r\n1 cup evaporated milk\r\n7 cups bread flour\r\n1\/4 cup shortening\r\nNonstick spray\r\nOil, for deep-frying\r\n3 cups confectioners' sugar\r\n",
      "Directions": "Mix water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl and let sit for 10 minutes.\r\nIn another bowl, beat the eggs, salt and evaporated milk together. Mix egg mixture to the yeast mixture. In a separate bowl, measure out the bread flour. Add 3 cups of the flour to the yeast mixture and stir to combine. Add the shortening and continue to stir while adding the remaining flour. Remove dough from the bowl, place onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Spray a large bowl with nonstick spray. Put dough into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a towel. Let rise in a warm place for at least 2 hours.\r\nPreheat oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F.\r\nAdd the confectioners' sugar to a paper or plastic bag and set aside.\r\nRoll the dough out to about 1\/4-inch thickness and cut into 1-inch squares. Deep-fry, flipping constantly, until they become a golden color. After beignets are fried, drain them for a few seconds on paper towels, and then toss them into the bag of confectioners' sugar. Hold bag closed and shake to coat evenly.\r\n"

The main thing is to stay away from the meat sauces or heavily seasoned ones, they simply aren't as good. The whole point of Creole is to balance the taste of shrimp, tomato, and the seasonings without overpowering any one item.\r\n"

Cook over low heat until a dark brown roux (the color of peanut butter) is formed. Do not try to hurry this step. The roux is the most important part of any gumbo base, and will take approximately 20-30 minutes of stirring to get it right. It's worth the wait.\r\nWhen the roux reaches the right color, quickly add the sausage, onion, green pepper, scallion tops, ham, parsley and garlic. Continue cooking over low heat for 10 minutes more, still stirring, then add 1\/4 cup of the water, the reserved chicken pieces and all the seasonings except the file powder; mix thoroughly. Gradually stir in the rest of the water. Raise the heat and bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer the gumbo for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until the chicken parts are tender.
